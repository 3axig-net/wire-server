.. _checks:

What sort of checks should I run after a successful installation?
=================================================================

After a successful installation of wire-server and its components, there are some useful checks to be run to ensure the proper functioning of the system. Here's a non-exhaustive list of checks to run on the hosts:

 - Ensure that NTP has been properly set up (:ref:`ntp-check`)
 - Same for log rotation (:ref:`logrotation-check`)

NOTE: This page is a work in progress, more sections to be added soon.
