# Legal hold

A team admin may ask members of the team to be put under [legal hold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_hold). Once a person is prompted, they should then verify that the presented signature matches the one generated by the legalhold service to avoid any potential [MITM attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).

Conceptually, there are the following actors in this use case:
 * A team admin - someone who requests legal hold for a specific user
 * A team member - the user who will be put under legal hold
 * Backend - serves as intermediary between team members/admin and the Legal hold Service
 * Legal hold service - stores users' Legal hold devices on customers' premises
 * Legal hold device - a user's device that is managed by customers
