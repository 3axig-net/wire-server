Swagger API documentation (all public endpoints)
================================================

At the time of writing, both swagger version 1.2 and version 2.0 are in use. If you are an employee of Wire, you can log in here and try out requests in the browser; if not, you can make use of the "List Operations" button on both 1.2 and 2.0 pages to see the possible API requests.

Browse to our `staging swagger page <https://staging-nginz-https.zinfra.io/swagger-ui/>`_ to see rendered swagger documentation for most public endpoints.
