Brig @infra.a.com -> Federator @infra.a.com: (domain="b.com", component="brig", handle="alice")

Federator @infra.a.com -> DNS Resolver: DNS query: (service: "wire-server-federator", proto: "tcp", name: "b.com")

DNS Resolver -> Federator @infra.a.com: DNS response: (target: "infra.b.com")

Federator @infra.a.com -> Ingress @infra.b.com: mTLS session establishment

note:
Provides the Federator's client certificate.

Ingress @infra.b.com -> Federator @infra.a.com: mTLS session establishment response

note: After authenticating the given client certificate using the root of trust as per RFC 8446.

Federator @infra.b.com -> Brig @infra.b.com: (originDomain= "a.com", component="brig", path="federation/get-user-by-handle" handle="alice")

note: After checking that the content of the _target_ field in the DNS response is equivalent to that of the _infra-domain_ field in the request and that the content of the _domain_ field is on the allow list.
