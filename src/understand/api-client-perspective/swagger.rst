Swagger API documentation (all public endpoints)
================================================

Our staging system provides swagger documentation of our public rest
API.

We are currently (as of 2021-09-29) migrating our documentation into a
new system that is automatically checked for correctness.  The old
documentation may still be more complete, but the new one is more
reliable, and will completely replace the old one eventually.

Please check the new docs first, and if you can't find what you're
looking for, double-check the old.


New docs
--------

`new staging swagger <https://staging-nginz-https.zinfra.io/api/swagger-ui>`


Old docs
--------

At the time of writing, both swagger version 1.2 and version 2.0 are in use. If you are an employee of Wire, you can log in here and try out requests in the browser; if not, you can make use of the "List Operations" button on both 1.2 and 2.0 pages to see the possible API requests.

Browse to our `staging swagger page <https://staging-nginz-https.zinfra.io/swagger-ui/>`_ to see rendered swagger documentation for most public endpoints.
