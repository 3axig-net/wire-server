The `nginz{-tcp,-http}` services have been unified into a `nginz` service, and
moved into the nginz chart.

The nginz-ingress-services chart simply targets the `nginz` service, so there's
no need to set matching `service.nginz.external{Http,Tcp}Port` inside the
`nginx-ingress-services` chart anymore.

The `config.http.httpPort` and `config.ws.wsPort` values in the `nginz` chart
still configure the ports the `nginz` service is listening on.

Metrics were moved from `config.http.httpPort` to a new `http-metrics` port.

The `nginz` chart also gained support for `metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled`,
creating a `ServiceMonitor` resource to scrape metrics, like for other wire
services.
