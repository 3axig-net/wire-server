-- | Add a per-host hard connection limit. When there are more than N open connections to a
-- host, any attempt to establish a new connection to that host will immediately fail with
-- 'PerHostConnectionLimitReached'.
--
-- Existing limits in 'Manager' are more fine-grained: for instance, those limits apply to raw
-- and TLS connections separately. The limit set by 'addHardConnectionLimit' applies to all
-- connections to the host/port, regardless of their type.
--
-- Hosts are defined "whatever host is set in the 'Request'" so if there are several servers
-- behind a load balancer, we're still going to count them as a single host.
--
-- /Note 2019-02-05:/ @http-client@ Github issue requesting this functionality:
-- <https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/issues/307>. We might try to upstream our
-- implementation.
